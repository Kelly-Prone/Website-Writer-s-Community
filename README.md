Final Project: "Writer's Community" website
The purpose of the site is to involve the most diverse writers in the world in one place.
The web page has security as a login for each user, being possible to participate only those who are registered.
The project consists of 6 html pages with some separate css files (not to mix some parts like "boddy", "header") and the separate JavaScript file.
These pages are: "login", "home", "write", "organize", "community" and "contact".
In the "Home" tab, it is possible to preview the purpose of the site and teach how new users will be able to better use all the tools.
In "write" is where the main part happens, the user can write whatever he wants and can share this idea with his friends in the "community" tab, the section responsible for the social interaction of these young writers.
In the tab "organize" it has the function similar to the famous site "Trello", this tab allows to separate the best ideas for the project from future writers.
Allowing to add more stick notes if necessary.
And last but not least, in the "Contact" tab, the user will be able to contact me clarifying his doubts and suggestions for improvements on the website (the famous feedback).
Summary: The "Writer's Community" aims to help people to expose their ideas to other people, we know that writing a book is very difficult and takes a long time to reach an important level.
Besides that the purpose of the site is also to help in the reading and social interaction of these people, so that they can ask for help (when necessary) and form new friends.
In fact, reading is very important, and helps to develop cognitive activities (especially in children).
"Writer's Community" is proof that you can mix technology with books and make it very incredible!
